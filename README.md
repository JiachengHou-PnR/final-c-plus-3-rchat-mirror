### Plan

We're planning on writing a web chatroom application that allows users that go on the site to anonymously chat with the current people within it!

### Why?

Since the ongoing pandemic (2020) has people locked inside their houses and with social distancing being a must. We decided to create a little application to get people chatting and having at least a little interaction with each other in these unsocial times.
